<section class="package-description" id="package-description">
<div class="block">Classes to support functional-style operations on streams of elements, such
 as map-reduce transformations on collections.  For example:

 <pre><code>
     int sum = widgets.stream()
                      .filter(b -&gt; b.getColor() == RED)
                      .mapToInt(b -&gt; b.getWeight())
                      .sum();
 </code></pre>

 <p>Here we use <code>widgets</code>, a <code>Collection&lt;Widget&gt;</code>,
 as a source for a stream, and then perform a filter-map-reduce on the stream
 to obtain the sum of the weights of the red widgets.  (Summation is an
 example of a <a href="package-summary.html#Reduction">reduction</a>
 operation.)

 <p>The key abstraction introduced in this package is <em>stream</em>.  The
 classes <a href="Stream.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>Stream</code></a>, <a href="IntStream.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>IntStream</code></a>,
 <a href="LongStream.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>LongStream</code></a>, and <a href="DoubleStream.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>DoubleStream</code></a>
 are streams over objects and the primitive <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and
 <code>double</code> types.  Streams differ from collections in several ways:

 <ul>
     <li>No storage.  A stream is not a data structure that stores elements;
     instead, it conveys elements from a source such as a data structure,
     an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of
     computational operations.</li>
     <li>Functional in nature.  An operation on a stream produces a result,
     but does not modify its source.  For example, filtering a <code>Stream</code>
     obtained from a collection produces a new <code>Stream</code> without the
     filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source
     collection.</li>
     <li>Laziness-seeking.  Many stream operations, such as filtering, mapping,
     or duplicate removal, can be implemented lazily, exposing opportunities
     for optimization.  For example, "find the first <code>String</code> with
     three consecutive vowels" need not examine all the input strings.
     Stream operations are divided into intermediate (<code>Stream</code>-producing)
     operations and terminal (value- or side-effect-producing) operations.
     Intermediate operations are always lazy.</li>
     <li>Possibly unbounded.  While collections have a finite size, streams
     need not.  Short-circuiting operations such as <code>limit(n)</code> or
     <code>findFirst()</code> can allow computations on infinite streams to
     complete in finite time.</li>
     <li>Consumable. The elements of a stream are only visited once during
     the life of a stream. Like an <a href="../Iterator.html" title="interface in java.util"><code>Iterator</code></a>, a new stream
     must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.
     </li>
 </ul>

 Streams can be obtained in a number of ways. Some examples include:
 <ul>
     <li>From a <a href="../Collection.html" title="interface in java.util"><code>Collection</code></a> via the <code>stream()</code> and
     <code>parallelStream()</code> methods;</li>
     <li>From an array via <a href="../Arrays.html#stream(T%5B%5D)"><code>Arrays.stream(Object[])</code></a>;</li>
     <li>From static factory methods on the stream classes, such as
     <a href="Stream.html#of(T...)"><code>Stream.of(Object[])</code></a>,
     <a href="IntStream.html#range(int,int)"><code>IntStream.range(int, int)</code></a>
     or <a href="Stream.html#iterate(T,java.util.function.UnaryOperator)"><code>Stream.iterate(Object, UnaryOperator)</code></a>;</li>
     <li>The lines of a file can be obtained from <a href="../../io/BufferedReader.html#lines()"><code>BufferedReader.lines()</code></a>;</li>
     <li>Streams of file paths can be obtained from methods in <a href="../../nio/file/Files.html" title="class in java.nio.file"><code>Files</code></a>;</li>
     <li>Streams of random numbers can be obtained from <a href="../Random.html#ints()"><code>Random.ints()</code></a>;</li>
     <li>Numerous other stream-bearing methods in the JDK, including
     <a href="../BitSet.html#stream()"><code>BitSet.stream()</code></a>,
     <a href="../regex/Pattern.html#splitAsStream(java.lang.CharSequence)"><code>Pattern.splitAsStream(java.lang.CharSequence)</code></a>,
     and <a href="../jar/JarFile.html#stream()"><code>JarFile.stream()</code></a>.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Additional stream sources can be provided by third-party libraries using
 <a href="package-summary.html#StreamSources">these techniques</a>.

 <h2><a id="StreamOps">Stream operations and pipelines</a></h2>

 <p>Stream operations are divided into <em>intermediate</em> and
 <em>terminal</em> operations, and are combined to form <em>stream
 pipelines</em>.  A stream pipeline consists of a source (such as a
 <code>Collection</code>, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel);
 followed by zero or more intermediate operations such as
 <code>Stream.filter</code> or <code>Stream.map</code>; and a terminal operation such
 as <code>Stream.forEach</code> or <code>Stream.reduce</code>.

 <p>Intermediate operations return a new stream.  They are always
 <em>lazy</em>; executing an intermediate operation such as
 <code>filter()</code> does not actually perform any filtering, but instead
 creates a new stream that, when traversed, contains the elements of
 the initial stream that match the given predicate.  Traversal
 of the pipeline source does not begin until the terminal operation of the
 pipeline is executed.

 <p>Terminal operations, such as <code>Stream.forEach</code> or
 <code>IntStream.sum</code>, may traverse the stream to produce a result or a
 side-effect. After the terminal operation is performed, the stream pipeline
 is considered consumed, and can no longer be used; if you need to traverse
 the same data source again, you must return to the data source to get a new
 stream.  In almost all cases, terminal operations are <em>eager</em>,
 completing their traversal of the data source and processing of the pipeline
 before returning.  Only the terminal operations <code>iterator()</code> and
 <code>spliterator()</code> are not; these are provided as an "escape hatch" to enable
 arbitrary client-controlled pipeline traversals in the event that the
 existing operations are not sufficient to the task.

 <p> Processing streams lazily allows for significant efficiencies; in a
 pipeline such as the filter-map-sum example above, filtering, mapping, and
 summing can be fused into a single pass on the data, with minimal
 intermediate state. Laziness also allows avoiding examining all the data
 when it is not necessary; for operations such as "find the first string
 longer than 1000 characters", it is only necessary to examine just enough
 strings to find one that has the desired characteristics without examining
 all of the strings available from the source. (This behavior becomes even
 more important when the input stream is infinite and not merely large.)

 <p>Intermediate operations are further divided into <em>stateless</em>
 and <em>stateful</em> operations. Stateless operations, such as <code>filter</code>
 and <code>map</code>, retain no state from previously seen element when processing
 a new element -- each element can be processed
 independently of operations on other elements.  Stateful operations, such as
 <code>distinct</code> and <code>sorted</code>, may incorporate state from previously
 seen elements when processing new elements.

 <p>Stateful operations may need to process the entire input
 before producing a result.  For example, one cannot produce any results from
 sorting a stream until one has seen all elements of the stream.  As a result,
 under parallel computation, some pipelines containing stateful intermediate
 operations may require multiple passes on the data or may need to buffer
 significant data.  Pipelines containing exclusively stateless intermediate
 operations can be processed in a single pass, whether sequential or parallel,
 with minimal data buffering.

 <p>Further, some operations are deemed <em>short-circuiting</em> operations.
 An intermediate operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with
 infinite input, it may produce a finite stream as a result.  A terminal
 operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input, it may
 terminate in finite time.  Having a short-circuiting operation in the pipeline
 is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the processing of an infinite
 stream to terminate normally in finite time.

 <h3><a id="Parallelism">Parallelism</a></h3>

 <p>Processing elements with an explicit <code>for-</code>loop is inherently serial.
 Streams facilitate parallel execution by reframing the computation as a pipeline of
 aggregate operations, rather than as imperative operations on each individual
 element.  All streams operations can execute either in serial or in parallel.
 The stream implementations in the JDK create serial streams unless parallelism is
 explicitly requested.  For example, <code>Collection</code> has methods
 <a href="../Collection.html#stream()"><code>Collection.stream()</code></a> and <a href="../Collection.html#parallelStream()"><code>Collection.parallelStream()</code></a>,
 which produce sequential and parallel streams respectively; other
 stream-bearing methods such as <a href="IntStream.html#range(int,int)"><code>IntStream.range(int, int)</code></a>
 produce sequential streams but these streams can be efficiently parallelized by
 invoking their <a href="BaseStream.html#parallel()"><code>BaseStream.parallel()</code></a> method.
 To execute the prior "sum of weights of widgets" query in parallel, we would
 do:

 <pre><code>
     int sumOfWeights = widgets.parallelStream()
                               .filter(b -&gt; b.getColor() == RED)
                               .mapToInt(b -&gt; b.getWeight())
                               .sum();
 </code></pre>

 <p>The only difference between the serial and parallel versions of this
 example is the creation of the initial stream, using "<code>parallelStream()</code>"
 instead of "<code>stream()</code>". The stream pipeline is executed sequentially or
 in parallel depending on the mode of the stream on which the terminal operation
 is invoked. The sequential or parallel mode of a stream can be determined with the
 <a href="BaseStream.html#isParallel()"><code>BaseStream.isParallel()</code></a> method, and the
 stream's mode can be modified with the
 <a href="BaseStream.html#sequential()"><code>BaseStream.sequential()</code></a> and
 <a href="BaseStream.html#parallel()"><code>BaseStream.parallel()</code></a> operations.
 The most recent sequential or parallel mode setting applies to the
 execution of the entire stream pipeline.

 <p>Except for operations identified as explicitly nondeterministic, such
 as <code>findAny()</code>, whether a stream executes sequentially or in parallel
 should not change the result of the computation.

 <p>Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified
 behavior, which are often lambda expressions.  To preserve correct behavior,
 these <em>behavioral parameters</em> must be <em>non-interfering</em>, and in
 most cases must be <em>stateless</em>.  Such parameters are always instances
 of a <a href="../function/package-summary.html">functional interface</a> such
 as <a href="../function/Function.html" title="interface in java.util.function"><code>Function</code></a>, and are often lambda expressions or
 method references.

 <h3><a id="NonInterference">Non-interference</a></h3>

 Streams enable you to execute possibly-parallel aggregate operations over a
 variety of data sources, including even non-thread-safe collections such as
 <code>ArrayList</code>. This is possible only if we can prevent
 <em>interference</em> with the data source during the execution of a stream
 pipeline.  Except for the escape-hatch operations <code>iterator()</code> and
 <code>spliterator()</code>, execution begins when the terminal operation is
 invoked, and ends when the terminal operation completes.  For most data
 sources, preventing interference means ensuring that the data source is
 <em>not modified at all</em> during the execution of the stream pipeline.
 The notable exception to this are streams whose sources are concurrent
 collections, which are specifically designed to handle concurrent modification.
 Concurrent stream sources are those whose <code>Spliterator</code> reports the
 <code>CONCURRENT</code> characteristic.

 <p>Accordingly, behavioral parameters in stream pipelines whose source might
 not be concurrent should never modify the stream's data source.
 A behavioral parameter is said to <em>interfere</em> with a non-concurrent
 data source if it modifies, or causes to be
 modified, the stream's data source.  The need for non-interference applies
 to all pipelines, not just parallel ones.  Unless the stream source is
 concurrent, modifying a stream's data source during execution of a stream
 pipeline can cause exceptions, incorrect answers, or nonconformant behavior.

 For well-behaved stream sources, the source can be modified before the
 terminal operation commences and those modifications will be reflected in
 the covered elements.  For example, consider the following code:

 <pre><code>
     List&lt;String&gt; l = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("one", "two"));
     Stream&lt;String&gt; sl = l.stream();
     l.add("three");
     String s = sl.collect(joining(" "));
 </code></pre>

 First a list is created consisting of two strings: "one" and "two". Then a
 stream is created from that list. Next the list is modified by adding a third
 string: "three". Finally the elements of the stream are collected and joined
 together. Since the list was modified before the terminal <code>collect</code>
 operation commenced the result will be a string of "one two three". All the
 streams returned from JDK collections, and most other JDK classes,
 are well-behaved in this manner; for streams generated by other libraries, see
 <a href="package-summary.html#StreamSources">Low-level stream
 construction</a> for requirements for building well-behaved streams.

 <h3><a id="Statelessness">Stateless behaviors</a></h3>

 Stream pipeline results may be nondeterministic or incorrect if the behavioral
 parameters to the stream operations are <em>stateful</em>.  A stateful lambda
 (or other object implementing the appropriate functional interface) is one
 whose result depends on any state which might change during the execution
 of the stream pipeline.  An example of a stateful lambda is the parameter
 to <code>map()</code> in:

 <pre><code>
     Set&lt;Integer&gt; seen = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet&lt;&gt;());
     stream.parallel().map(e -&gt; { if (seen.add(e)) return 0; else return e; })...
 </code></pre>

 Here, if the mapping operation is performed in parallel, the results for the
 same input could vary from run to run, due to thread scheduling differences,
 whereas, with a stateless lambda expression the results would always be the
 same.

 <p>Note also that attempting to access mutable state from behavioral parameters
 presents you with a bad choice with respect to safety and performance; if
 you do not synchronize access to that state, you have a data race and
 therefore your code is broken, but if you do synchronize access to that
 state, you risk having contention undermine the parallelism you are seeking
 to benefit from.  The best approach is to avoid stateful behavioral
 parameters to stream operations entirely; there is usually a way to
 restructure the stream pipeline to avoid statefulness.

 <h3><a id="SideEffects">Side-effects</a></h3>

 Side-effects in behavioral parameters to stream operations are, in general,
 discouraged, as they can often lead to unwitting violations of the
 statelessness requirement, as well as other thread-safety hazards.

 <p>If the behavioral parameters do have side-effects, unless explicitly
 stated, there are no guarantees as to:
 <ul>
    <li>the <a href="../concurrent/package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility">
    <i>visibility</i></a> of those side-effects to other threads;</li>
    <li>that different operations on the "same" element within the same stream
    pipeline are executed in the same thread; and</li>
    <li>that behavioral parameters are always invoked, since a stream
    implementation is free to elide operations (or entire stages) from a
    stream pipeline if it can prove that it would not affect the result of the
    computation.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <p>The ordering of side-effects may be surprising.  Even when a pipeline is
 constrained to produce a <em>result</em> that is consistent with the
 encounter order of the stream source (for example,
 <code>IntStream.range(0,5).parallel().map(x -&gt; x*2).toArray()</code>
 must produce <code>[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]</code>), no guarantees are made as to the order
 in which the mapper function is applied to individual elements, or in what
 thread any behavioral parameter is executed for a given element.

 <p>The eliding of side-effects may also be surprising.  With the exception of
 terminal operations <a href="Stream.html#forEach(java.util.function.Consumer)"><code>forEach</code></a> and
 <a href="Stream.html#forEachOrdered(java.util.function.Consumer)"><code>forEachOrdered</code></a>, side-effects
 of behavioral parameters may not always be executed when the stream
 implementation can optimize away the execution of behavioral parameters
 without affecting the result of the computation.  (For a specific example
 see the API note documented on the <a href="Stream.html#count()"><code>count</code></a>
 operation.)

 <p>Many computations where one might be tempted to use side-effects can be more
 safely and efficiently expressed without side-effects, such as using
 <a href="package-summary.html#Reduction">reduction</a> instead of mutable
 accumulators. However, side-effects such as using <code>println()</code> for debugging
 purposes are usually harmless.  A small number of stream operations, such as
 <code>forEach()</code> and <code>peek()</code>, can operate only via side-effects;
 these should be used with care.

 <p>As an example of how to transform a stream pipeline that inappropriately
 uses side-effects to one that does not, the following code searches a stream
 of strings for those matching a given regular expression, and puts the
 matches in a list.

 <pre><code>
     ArrayList&lt;String&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
     stream.filter(s -&gt; pattern.matcher(s).matches())
           .forEach(s -&gt; results.add(s));  // Unnecessary use of side-effects!
 </code></pre>

 This code unnecessarily uses side-effects.  If executed in parallel, the
 non-thread-safety of <code>ArrayList</code> would cause incorrect results, and
 adding needed synchronization would cause contention, undermining the
 benefit of parallelism.  Furthermore, using side-effects here is completely
 unnecessary; the <code>forEach()</code> can simply be replaced with a reduction
 operation that is safer, more efficient, and more amenable to
 parallelization:

 <pre><code>
     List&lt;String&gt; results =
         stream.filter(s -&gt; pattern.matcher(s).matches())
               .toList();  // No side-effects!
 </code></pre>

 <h3><a id="Ordering">Ordering</a></h3>

 <p>Streams may or may not have a defined <em>encounter order</em>.  Whether
 or not a stream has an encounter order depends on the source and the
 intermediate operations.  Certain stream sources (such as <code>List</code> or
 arrays) are intrinsically ordered, whereas others (such as <code>HashSet</code>)
 are not.  Some intermediate operations, such as <code>sorted()</code>, may impose
 an encounter order on an otherwise unordered stream, and others may render an
 ordered stream unordered, such as <a href="BaseStream.html#unordered()"><code>BaseStream.unordered()</code></a>.
 Further, some terminal operations may ignore encounter order, such as
 <code>forEach()</code>.

 <p>If a stream is ordered, most operations are constrained to operate on the
 elements in their encounter order; if the source of a stream is a <code>List</code>
 containing <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, then the result of executing <code>map(x -&gt; x*2)</code>
 must be <code>[2, 4, 6]</code>.  However, if the source has no defined encounter
 order, then any permutation of the values <code>[2, 4, 6]</code> would be a valid
 result.

 <p>For sequential streams, the presence or absence of an encounter order does
 not affect performance, only determinism.  If a stream is ordered, repeated
 execution of identical stream pipelines on an identical source will produce
 an identical result; if it is not ordered, repeated execution might produce
 different results.

 <p>For parallel streams, relaxing the ordering constraint can sometimes enable
 more efficient execution.  Certain aggregate operations,
 such as filtering duplicates (<code>distinct()</code>) or grouped reductions
 (<code>Collectors.groupingBy()</code>) can be implemented more efficiently if ordering of elements
 is not relevant.  Similarly, operations that are intrinsically tied to encounter order,
 such as <code>limit()</code>, may require
 buffering to ensure proper ordering, undermining the benefit of parallelism.
 In cases where the stream has an encounter order, but the user does not
 particularly <em>care</em> about that encounter order, explicitly de-ordering
 the stream with <a href="BaseStream.html#unordered()"><code>unordered()</code></a> may
 improve parallel performance for some stateful or terminal operations.
 However, most stream pipelines, such as the "sum of weight of blocks" example
 above, still parallelize efficiently even under ordering constraints.

 <h2><a id="Reduction">Reduction operations</a></h2>

 A <em>reduction</em> operation (also called a <em>fold</em>) takes a sequence
 of input elements and combines them into a single summary result by repeated
 application of a combining operation, such as finding the sum or maximum of
 a set of numbers, or accumulating elements into a list.  The streams classes have
 multiple forms of general reduction operations, called
 <a href="Stream.html#reduce(java.util.function.BinaryOperator)"><code>reduce()</code></a>
 and <a href="Stream.html#collect(java.util.stream.Collector)"><code>collect()</code></a>,
 as well as multiple specialized reduction forms such as
 <a href="IntStream.html#sum()"><code>sum()</code></a>, <a href="IntStream.html#max()"><code>max()</code></a>,
 or <a href="IntStream.html#count()"><code>count()</code></a>.

 <p>Of course, such operations can be readily implemented as simple sequential
 loops, as in:
 <pre><code>
    int sum = 0;
    for (int x : numbers) {
       sum += x;
    }
 </code></pre>
 However, there are good reasons to prefer a reduce operation
 over a mutative accumulation such as the above.  Not only is a reduction
 "more abstract" -- it operates on the stream as a whole rather than individual
 elements -- but a properly constructed reduce operation is inherently
 parallelizable, so long as the function(s) used to process the elements
 are <a href="package-summary.html#Associativity">associative</a> and
 <a href="package-summary.html#Statelessness">stateless</a>.
 For example, given a stream of numbers for which we want to find the sum, we
 can write:
 <pre><code>
    int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (x,y) -&gt; x+y);
 </code></pre>
 or:
 <pre><code>
    int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
 </code></pre>

 <p>These reduction operations can run safely in parallel with almost no
 modification:
 <pre><code>
    int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
 </code></pre>

 <p>Reduction parallellizes well because the implementation
 can operate on subsets of the data in parallel, and then combine the
 intermediate results to get the final correct answer.  (Even if the language
 had a "parallel for-each" construct, the mutative accumulation approach would
 still require the developer to provide
 thread-safe updates to the shared accumulating variable <code>sum</code>, and
 the required synchronization would then likely eliminate any performance gain from
 parallelism.)  Using <code>reduce()</code> instead removes all of the
 burden of parallelizing the reduction operation, and the library can provide
 an efficient parallel implementation with no additional synchronization
 required.

 <p>The "widgets" examples shown earlier shows how reduction combines with
 other operations to replace for-loops with bulk operations.  If <code>widgets</code>
 is a collection of <code>Widget</code> objects, which have a <code>getWeight</code> method,
 we can find the heaviest widget with:
 <pre><code>
     OptionalInt heaviest = widgets.parallelStream()
                                   .mapToInt(Widget::getWeight)
                                   .max();
 </code></pre>

 <p>In its more general form, a <code>reduce</code> operation on elements of type
 <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> yielding a result of type <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> requires three parameters:
 <pre><code>
 &lt;U&gt; U reduce(U identity,
              BiFunction&lt;U, ? super T, U&gt; accumulator,
              BinaryOperator&lt;U&gt; combiner);
 </code></pre>
 Here, the <em>identity</em> element is both an initial seed value for the reduction
 and a default result if there are no input elements. The <em>accumulator</em>
 function takes a partial result and the next element, and produces a new
 partial result. The <em>combiner</em> function combines two partial results
 to produce a new partial result.  (The combiner is necessary in parallel
 reductions, where the input is partitioned, a partial accumulation computed
 for each partition, and then the partial results are combined to produce a
 final result.)

 <p>More formally, the <code>identity</code> value must be an <em>identity</em> for
 the combiner function. This means that for all <code>u</code>,
 <code>combiner.apply(identity, u)</code> is equal to <code>u</code>. Additionally, the
 <code>combiner</code> function must be <a href="package-summary.html#Associativity">associative</a> and
 must be compatible with the <code>accumulator</code> function: for all <code>u</code>
 and <code>t</code>, <code>combiner.apply(u, accumulator.apply(identity, t))</code> must
 be <code>equals()</code> to <code>accumulator.apply(u, t)</code>.

 <p>The three-argument form is a generalization of the two-argument form,
 incorporating a mapping step into the accumulation step.  We could
 re-cast the simple sum-of-weights example using the more general form as
 follows:
 <pre><code>
     int sumOfWeights = widgets.stream()
                               .reduce(0,
                                       (sum, b) -&gt; sum + b.getWeight(),
                                       Integer::sum);
 </code></pre>
 though the explicit map-reduce form is more readable and therefore should
 usually be preferred. The generalized form is provided for cases where
 significant work can be optimized away by combining mapping and reducing
 into a single function.

 <h3><a id="MutableReduction">Mutable reduction</a></h3>

 A <em>mutable reduction operation</em> accumulates input elements into a
 mutable result container, such as a <code>Collection</code> or <code>StringBuilder</code>,
 as it processes the elements in the stream.

 <p>If we wanted to take a stream of strings and concatenate them into a
 single long string, we <em>could</em> achieve this with ordinary reduction:
 <pre><code>
     String concatenated = strings.reduce("", String::concat)
 </code></pre>

 <p>We would get the desired result, and it would even work in parallel.  However,
 we might not be happy about the performance!  Such an implementation would do
 a great deal of string copying, and the run time would be <em>O(n^2)</em> in
 the number of characters.  A more performant approach would be to accumulate
 the results into a <a href="../../lang/StringBuilder.html" title="class in java.lang"><code>StringBuilder</code></a>, which is a mutable
 container for accumulating strings.  We can use the same technique to
 parallelize mutable reduction as we do with ordinary reduction.

 <p>The mutable reduction operation is called
 <a href="Stream.html#collect(java.util.stream.Collector)"><code>collect()</code></a>,
 as it collects together the desired results into a result container such
 as a <code>Collection</code>.
 A <code>collect</code> operation requires three functions:
 a supplier function to construct new instances of the result container, an
 accumulator function to incorporate an input element into a result
 container, and a combining function to merge the contents of one result
 container into another.  The form of this is very similar to the general
 form of ordinary reduction:
 <pre><code>
 &lt;R&gt; R collect(Supplier&lt;R&gt; supplier,
               BiConsumer&lt;R, ? super T&gt; accumulator,
               BiConsumer&lt;R, R&gt; combiner);
 </code></pre>
 <p>As with <code>reduce()</code>, a benefit of expressing <code>collect</code> in this
 abstract way is that it is directly amenable to parallelization: we can
 accumulate partial results in parallel and then combine them, so long as the
 accumulation and combining functions satisfy the appropriate requirements.
 For example, to collect the String representations of the elements in a
 stream into an <code>ArrayList</code>, we could write the obvious sequential
 for-each form:
 <pre><code>
     ArrayList&lt;String&gt; strings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
     for (T element : stream) {
         strings.add(element.toString());
     }
 </code></pre>
 Or we could use a parallelizable collect form:
 <pre><code>
     ArrayList&lt;String&gt; strings = stream.collect(() -&gt; new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(),
                                                (c, e) -&gt; c.add(e.toString()),
                                                (c1, c2) -&gt; c1.addAll(c2));
 </code></pre>
 or, pulling the mapping operation out of the accumulator function, we could
 express it more succinctly as:
 <pre><code>
     List&lt;String&gt; strings = stream.map(Object::toString)
                                  .collect(ArrayList::new, ArrayList::add, ArrayList::addAll);
 </code></pre>
 Here, our supplier is just the <a href="../ArrayList.html#%3Cinit%3E()"><code>ArrayList constructor</code></a>, the accumulator adds the stringified element to an
 <code>ArrayList</code>, and the combiner simply uses <a href="../ArrayList.html#addAll(java.util.Collection)"><code>addAll</code></a>
 to copy the strings from one container into the other.

 <p>The three aspects of <code>collect</code> -- supplier, accumulator, and
 combiner -- are tightly coupled.  We can use the abstraction of a
 <a href="Collector.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>Collector</code></a> to capture all three aspects.  The
 above example for collecting strings into a <code>List</code> can be rewritten
 using a standard <code>Collector</code> as:
 <pre><code>
     List&lt;String&gt; strings = stream.map(Object::toString)
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
 </code></pre>

 <p>Packaging mutable reductions into a Collector has another advantage:
 composability.  The class <a href="Collectors.html" title="class in java.util.stream"><code>Collectors</code></a> contains a
 number of predefined factories for collectors, including combinators
 that transform one collector into another.  For example, suppose we have a
 collector that computes the sum of the salaries of a stream of
 employees, as follows:

 <pre><code>
     Collector&lt;Employee, ?, Integer&gt; summingSalaries
         = Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary);
 </code></pre>

 (The <code>?</code> for the second type parameter merely indicates that we don't
 care about the intermediate representation used by this collector.)
 If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
 department, we could reuse <code>summingSalaries</code> using
 <a href="Collectors.html#groupingBy(java.util.function.Function,java.util.stream.Collector)"><code>groupingBy</code></a>:

 <pre><code>
     Map&lt;Department, Integer&gt; salariesByDept
         = employees.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                                                            summingSalaries));
 </code></pre>

 <p>As with the regular reduction operation, <code>collect()</code> operations can
 only be parallelized if appropriate conditions are met.  For any partially
 accumulated result, combining it with an empty result container must
 produce an equivalent result.  That is, for a partially accumulated result
 <code>p</code> that is the result of any series of accumulator and combiner
 invocations, <code>p</code> must be equivalent to
 <code>combiner.apply(p, supplier.get())</code>.

 <p>Further, however the computation is split, it must produce an equivalent
 result.  For any input elements <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code>, the results
 <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> in the computation below must be equivalent:
 <pre><code>
     A a1 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
     accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
     R r1 = finisher.apply(a1);  // result without splitting

     A a2 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
     A a3 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
     R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3));  // result with splitting
 </code></pre>

 <p>Here, equivalence generally means according to <a href="../../lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><code>Object.equals(Object)</code></a>.
 but in some cases equivalence may be relaxed to account for differences in
 order.

 <h3><a id="ConcurrentReduction">Reduction, concurrency, and ordering</a></h3>

 With some complex reduction operations, for example a <code>collect()</code> that
 produces a <code>Map</code>, such as:
 <pre><code>
     Map&lt;Buyer, List&lt;Transaction&gt;&gt; salesByBuyer
         = txns.parallelStream()
               .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Transaction::getBuyer));
 </code></pre>
 it may actually be counterproductive to perform the operation in parallel.
 This is because the combining step (merging one <code>Map</code> into another by
 key) can be expensive for some <code>Map</code> implementations.

 <p>Suppose, however, that the result container used in this reduction
 was a concurrently modifiable collection -- such as a
 <a href="../concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html" title="class in java.util.concurrent"><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code></a>. In that case, the parallel
 invocations of the accumulator could actually deposit their results
 concurrently into the same shared result container, eliminating the need for
 the combiner to merge distinct result containers. This potentially provides
 a boost to the parallel execution performance. We call this a
 <em>concurrent</em> reduction.

 <p>A <a href="Collector.html" title="interface in java.util.stream"><code>Collector</code></a> that supports concurrent reduction is
 marked with the <a href="Collector.Characteristics.html#CONCURRENT"><code>Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT</code></a>
 characteristic.  However, a concurrent collection also has a downside.  If
 multiple threads are depositing results concurrently into a shared container,
 the order in which results are deposited is non-deterministic. Consequently,
 a concurrent reduction is only possible if ordering is not important for the
 stream being processed. The <a href="Stream.html#collect(java.util.stream.Collector)"><code>Stream.collect(Collector)</code></a>
 implementation will only perform a concurrent reduction if
 <ul>
 <li>The stream is parallel;</li>
 <li>The collector has the
 <a href="Collector.Characteristics.html#CONCURRENT"><code>Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT</code></a> characteristic,
 and;</li>
 <li>Either the stream is unordered, or the collector has the
 <a href="Collector.Characteristics.html#UNORDERED"><code>Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED</code></a> characteristic.
 </ul>
 You can ensure the stream is unordered by using the
 <a href="BaseStream.html#unordered()"><code>BaseStream.unordered()</code></a> method.  For example:
 <pre><code>
     Map&lt;Buyer, List&lt;Transaction&gt;&gt; salesByBuyer
         = txns.parallelStream()
               .unordered()
               .collect(groupingByConcurrent(Transaction::getBuyer));
 </code></pre>
 (where <a href="Collectors.html#groupingByConcurrent(java.util.function.Function)"><code>Collectors.groupingByConcurrent(java.util.function.Function&lt;? super T, ? extends K&gt;)</code></a> is the
 concurrent equivalent of <code>groupingBy</code>).

 <p>Note that if it is important that the elements for a given key appear in
 the order they appear in the source, then we cannot use a concurrent
 reduction, as ordering is one of the casualties of concurrent insertion.
 We would then be constrained to implement either a sequential reduction or
 a merge-based parallel reduction.

 <h3><a id="Associativity">Associativity</a></h3>

 An operator or function <code>op</code> is <em>associative</em> if the following
 holds:
 <pre><code>
     (a op b) op c == a op (b op c)
 </code></pre>
 The importance of this to parallel evaluation can be seen if we expand this
 to four terms:
 <pre><code>
     a op b op c op d == (a op b) op (c op d)
 </code></pre>
 So we can evaluate <code>(a op b)</code> in parallel with <code>(c op d)</code>, and
 then invoke <code>op</code> on the results.

 <p>Examples of associative operations include numeric addition, min, and
 max, and string concatenation.

 <h2><a id="StreamSources">Low-level stream construction</a></h2>

 So far, all the stream examples have used methods like
 <a href="../Collection.html#stream()"><code>Collection.stream()</code></a> or <a href="../Arrays.html#stream(T%5B%5D)"><code>Arrays.stream(Object[])</code></a>
 to obtain a stream.  How are those stream-bearing methods implemented?

 <p>The class <a href="StreamSupport.html" title="class in java.util.stream"><code>StreamSupport</code></a> has a number of
 low-level methods for creating a stream, all using some form of a
 <a href="../Spliterator.html" title="interface in java.util"><code>Spliterator</code></a>. A spliterator is the parallel analogue of an
 <a href="../Iterator.html" title="interface in java.util"><code>Iterator</code></a>; it describes a (possibly infinite) collection of
 elements, with support for sequentially advancing, bulk traversal, and
 splitting off some portion of the input into another spliterator which can
 be processed in parallel.  At the lowest level, all streams are driven by a
 spliterator.

 <p>There are a number of implementation choices in implementing a
 spliterator, nearly all of which are tradeoffs between simplicity of
 implementation and runtime performance of streams using that spliterator.
 The simplest, but least performant, way to create a spliterator is to
 create one from an iterator using
 <a href="../Spliterators.html#spliteratorUnknownSize(java.util.Iterator,int)"><code>Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(java.util.Iterator, int)</code></a>.
 While such a spliterator will work, it will likely offer poor parallel
 performance, since we have lost sizing information (how big is the
 underlying data set), as well as being constrained to a simplistic
 splitting algorithm.

 <p>A higher-quality spliterator will provide balanced and known-size
 splits, accurate sizing information, and a number of other
 <a href="../Spliterator.html#characteristics()"><code>characteristics</code></a> of the
 spliterator or data that can be used by implementations to optimize
 execution.

 <p>Spliterators for mutable data sources have an additional challenge;
 timing of binding to the data, since the data could change between the time
 the spliterator is created and the time the stream pipeline is executed.
 Ideally, a spliterator for a stream would report a characteristic of
 <code>IMMUTABLE</code> or <code>CONCURRENT</code>; if not it should be
 <a href="../Spliterator.html#binding"><em>late-binding</em></a>. If a source
 cannot directly supply a recommended spliterator, it may indirectly supply
 a spliterator using a <code>Supplier</code>, and construct a stream via the
 <code>Supplier</code>-accepting versions of
 <a href="StreamSupport.html#stream(java.util.function.Supplier,int,boolean)"><code>stream()</code></a>.
 The spliterator is obtained from the supplier only after the terminal
 operation of the stream pipeline commences.

 <p>These requirements significantly reduce the scope of potential
 interference between mutations of the stream source and execution of stream
 pipelines. Streams based on spliterators with the desired characteristics,
 or those using the Supplier-based factory forms, are immune to
 modifications of the data source prior to commencement of the terminal
 operation (provided the behavioral parameters to the stream operations meet
 the required criteria for non-interference and statelessness).  See
